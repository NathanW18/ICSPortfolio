  <section id="about-me">
    <p>Hello! My name is Nathan and I am a student at William Lyon Mackenzie CI. Some of my hobbies, outside of programming, include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tennis</li>
      <li>Reading mystery novels (and fiction in general)</li>
      <li>Binging movies and TV shows</li>
      <li>Competitive debate (training, tournaments, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some volunteer work I’ve done:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Volunteering at student teacher interviews (X2, assisted with timing interviews, checking in parents, providing directions, and answering questions)</li>
      <li>Volunteering at a local YMCA fitness centre and assisting with customer service and membership</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Competitions and Achievements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2023 CCC Junior (64/75 - Honor Roll)
        <ul>
          <li>Topics include: Graph theory, recursion, ad hoc, arrays, 2D arrays</li>
          <li>Skills: Coding, algorithmic thinking, collaboration, creativity, debugging</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Top 3 in all monthly LCC in the 2023-2024 seasons
        <ul>
          <li>Worked with other team members to design and optimize data structures and algorithms in order to solve five problems in increasing difficulty</li>
          <li>Skills: Coding, algorithmic thinking, collaboration, debugging, creativity, leadership</li>
          <li>Topics include: Graph theory, recursion, ad hoc, arrays, 2D arrays, arraylist, dynamic programming (knapsack problem)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Math contests
        <ul>
          <li>From a young age, I have had a passion for math and thinking about problems. This passion has translated into my participation in contests, and ultimately the successful results that I have brought back.</li>
          <li>Cayley distinction (grade 10)</li>
          <li>Gauss Honor Roll (grade 7)</li>
          <li>Extracurricular math classes
            <ul>
              <li>Learning math skills ahead of my grade (since grade five)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Work:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ICS3UP Culminating - Beat the house fire interactive storybook and game (20+ hours, written in HSA Java)</li>
      <li>ICS2OP Culminating - Staying safe in a city interactive game (20+ hours, written in Processing)
        <ul>
          <li>In both of these culminating/ISP assignments, I had to do extra research myself in order to obtain information regarding how to make hte project more appealing and function better. For example, we wanted to make a player travel and animate using WASD keys like in a real video game. While I ultimately thought of a solution myself, I had to traverse various websites and read many articles to see other people’s experiences in making similar video games to make my code more efficient, neat, and powerful.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Taught myself C++ for competitive programming
        <ul>
          <li>261 problems completed on DMOJ, an online platform and judge for competitive programming problems. I consistently practice for 5 hours a week on advanced topics like recursion, graph theory, and dynamic programming. These skills have been applied to programming contests in and out of school, such as the CCC, LCC, and monthly DMOPC.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>THIS portfolio website you are looking at now
        <ul>
          <li>This website is hosted on GitHub pages. I had to understand how to use GitHub, the purpose of GitHub, GitHub commands in order to host this website and code the HTML of the website source code.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Who I am:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A well rounded person
        <ul>
          <li>From training myself on competitive debate topics like macroeconomics in my spare time to practicing CCC problems, I believe that knowing a lot — not merely in one field — is important to stand out amongst the crowd.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>A helpful and considerate person
        <ul>
          <li>My volunteer experience, such as at a fitness centre, are based on my willingness to help other people and improve their lives, whether it’s providing helpful directions to a parent on where to see a teacher for an interview or renewing a gym member’s annual membership. Thus, I am also very active in my community through doing various acts of community service.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Future Ideas</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Make a app, to be installed either on a phone or on a computer</li>
      <li>Create a program to analyze data from online sources to create conclusions. Then, publish the results of those conclusions in a study.</li>
      <li>Solve a really hard competitive programming problem</li>
      <li>Learn to code in another language (not Java, Python, or C++)</li>
      <li>Create a programming contest</li>
    </ul>
