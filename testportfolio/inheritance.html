    <h2>What is Inheritance?</h2>
    <p>Java is meant to be object oriented. Sometimes, you might want to create a class from another class. What does that mean? Well, for example, let’s say you made a class called Book. In book, you have methods for opening a book, reading a book, and changing the book’s cover. You also have instance variables, such as the book’s length as well as the color.</p>
    <p>Let’s say you wanted to make another class for a textbook. A textbook is a type of book, so we also have the same methods and instance variables as the book does. We could rewrite all the methods that are in Book into Textbook, but that would be inefficient and a waste of methods.</p>
    <p>Instead, we would make the Textbook inherit the Book class. When a class inherits another class, we call the class that inherits another class the subclass or child class, and the class that provides the inheritance the superclass or parent class.</p>
    <p>When one class inherits another:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Its methods are inherited.</li>
        <li>Its instance variables are inherited.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Inherit?</h2>
    <p>Here, we used inheritance in an assignment where we had to use Java to model a unique invention. Our unique invention idea was basically to create a swimsuit for people which creates a custom temperature that they can select while swimming.</p>

    <p>Next, we wanted to make a subclass of the Swimsuit class for children. This was basically the same thing as the subclass (it serves the same basic purpose), but with some additional functionalities, such as safety switches and alarms.</p>

    <h2>Purpose of Inheritance</h2>
    <p>Notice how the subclass is basically the same thing as the superclass but with some additional functionalities. So, we don’t have to rewrite every single method and variable all over again, but simply extend the class. Now, we say that the ChildSuit class “is a” Swimsuit, because the ChildSuit class extends the superclass. The example here is a prime example of how we can illustrate relationships between classes using inheritance -- in fact, certain methods and attributes are the same, and we just wanted to add some additional, unique features, like an alarm. Without using inheritance, oru code would be a lot more inefficient.Inheritance allows us to reuse code and implement relationships between classes, thus being crucial to Object Oriented Programming.</p>

  <section id="mistakes">
    <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
    <p>Some common mistakes for inheritance include using inheritance just for the sake of using inheritance, not fully understanding the relationship between the superclass and subclass. This results in few methods or attributes that are useful being reused and a lot of messy code. Remember, inheritance is not always the solution to reusing code!!! Read the tutorial above to understand when to use inheritance properly and most efficiently and effectively.</p>
